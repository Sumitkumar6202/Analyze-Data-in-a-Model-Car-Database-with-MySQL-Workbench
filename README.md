Model Car Database Analysis with MySQL Workbench
Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze data in a model car database using MySQL Workbench. The database contains information about scale model cars, including products, customers, orders, and sales data. Through a series of SQL queries, we can extract valuable business insights from this dataset.

Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:

Products: Model car details (product code, name, scale, vendor, quantity in stock, price)

ProductLines: Categories of model cars (classic, vintage, motorcycles, etc.)

Customers: Customer information and demographics

Orders: Sales transaction records

OrderDetails: Line items for each order

Employees: Sales representatives and their information

Offices: Regional office locations
